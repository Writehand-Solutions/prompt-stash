      paper_title: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Climate Change Mitigation
      paper_abstract: This paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing climate change. Through a comprehensive review of current AI applications in energy systems, transportation, and environmental monitoring, we identify key areas where AI can contribute to climate change mitigation. Our findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency across various sectors. However, we also highlight potential challenges and ethical considerations in the widespread adoption of AI for climate action.
